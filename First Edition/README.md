# Distributed Actors in Action

This is an attempt to port [Akka in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/akka-in-action) examples to Swift's [Distributed Actors](https://github.com/apple/swift-distributed-actors/).
Examples from the book are also [available here](https://github.com/RayRoestenburg/akka-in-action) in code.

**While going through First Edition of Akka in Action I’ve realised it’s a bit outdated. Will focus on Second Edition, but it’s still MEAP version and not fully finished. So repo will consist of two, which I’ll be updating slowly.**
