# Distributed Actors in Action, Second Edition

This is an attempt to port [Akka in Action, Second Edition](https://www.manning.com/books/akka-in-action-second-edition) examples to Swift's [Distributed Actors](https://github.com/apple/swift-distributed-actors/).
Examples from the book are also [available here](https://github.com/franciscolopezsancho/akka-topics) in code.

## Current progress

I'm going by MEAP version of the book, so it's not 100% complete and seems like not all examples are fully finished. Will go slowly and after release will start updating examples again and add some readme in terms of Akka vs. Distributed Actors differences.

* chapter02â€”done
* chapter03-done
* chapter04-skipped, will add tests to all examples a bit later
* chapter05-skipped
* chapter06-in progress
