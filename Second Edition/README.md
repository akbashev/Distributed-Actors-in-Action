# Distributed Actors in Action

This is an attempt to port [Akka in Action, Second Edition](https://www.manning.com/books/akka-in-action-second-edition) examples to Swift's [Distributed Actors](https://github.com/apple/swift-distributed-actors/).
Examples from the book are also [available here](https://github.com/franciscolopezsancho/akka-topics) in code.
